The blockchain-based project consists of 

- network layer  -->  blockchain network   --->   bc-iot-net
  - blockchain network consists of 3 kore layers: 
    - blockchain-data layer: block data, includes hash value, nonce value, timestamp, transaction data, encryption...
    - network layer: distributed storage, includes p2p communications, goosip ,grpc protocol...
    - consensus layer: includes PoW, PoS, DPos,...
- collaboration layer  --> collaboration
  - collaboration layer includes various approaches, algorithms and mechanisms 
    - col-learning:
    - mechanism:
- smart contract layer   -->  chaincode
- application layer   -->application
